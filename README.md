- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpates1. From Fashion to tech, I'm on a bit of a journey.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a web developer, focusing on front-end. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, via CS50 and freeCodeCamp, what else should I be doing?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for a little while, still learning the ropes.
- 📫 email jamesandrewpates@gmail.com
- 🧑🏼‍💻 @james_pates on twitter // instagram.
- 🚤 I live on a narrowboat in London, with my friendly Whippet companion 🐶, Jensen.
